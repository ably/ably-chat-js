# Ably Chat JavaScript Client Library SDK API Reference

The JavaScript Client Library SDK supports chat functionality over ably realtime. The JavaScript API references are generated from the [Ably Chat JavaScript Client Library SDK source code](https://github.com/ably-labs/ably-chat-js) using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) and structured by classes.

The Chat SDK is built on top of the Ably Realtime SDK and provides a higher-level API for building chat applications. It includes features such as entering/leaving conversations, sending messages, room reactions, presence, typing indicators, and more.

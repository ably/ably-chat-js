   * Creates a new ChatClient instance for interacting with Ably Chat.
   *
   * The ChatClient is the main entry point for the Ably Chat SDK. It requires a Realtime client
   * and provides access to chat rooms through the rooms property.
   *
   * **Important**: The Ably Realtime client must have a clientId set. This identifies
   * the user in chat rooms and is required for all chat operations.
   *
   * **NOTE**: You can provide optional overrides to the {@link ChatClient}, these will be merged
   * with the default options. See {@link ChatClientOptions} for the available options.
   * @param realtime - An initialized Ably Realtime client with a configured clientId
   * @param clientOptions - Optional configuration for the chat client
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * import * as Ably from 'ably';
   * import { ChatClient, LogLevel } from '@ably/chat';
   *
   * // Preferred in production: Use auth URL that returns a JWT
   * const realtimeClientWithJWT = new Ably.Realtime({
   *   authUrl: '/api/ably-auth', // Your server endpoint that returns an JWT with clientId
   *   authMethod: 'POST'
   * });
   *
   * const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClientWithJWT)
   *```
   * @example
   *```typescript
   * // Alternative for development and server-side operations: Set clientId directly (requires API key)
   * const realtimeClientWithKey = new Ably.Realtime({
   *   key: 'your-ably-api-key',
   *   clientId: 'user-123'
   * });
   *
   * const chatClient = new ChatClient(realtimeClientWithKey)
   * ```
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const realtimeClient = new Ably.Realtime({
   *   authUrl: '/api/ably-auth',
   *   authMethod: 'POST'
   * });
   *
   * // With custom logging configuration: Defaults to LogLevel.Info and console logging
   * const chatClientWithLogging = new ChatClient(realtimeClient, {
   *   logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
   *   logHandler: (message, level, context) => {
   *     // Send to your logging service
   *     yourLoggerInstance.log({
   *       level,
   *       message,
   *       context,
   *       timestamp: new Date()
   *     });

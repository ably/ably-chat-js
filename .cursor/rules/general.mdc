# Keep It Simple

When you are asked to make a change, don't make any changes that you're not asked for.

If you see an opportunity for improvement, make a suggestion and ask for approval to make the change.

# Always update the tests

Update the tests whenever you make a change.

Always run the tests after making changes to source code or tests in order to catch any regressions.

Ably Chat is a set of purpose-built APIs for a host of chat features enabling you to create 1:1, 1:Many, Many:1 and Many:Many chat rooms for any scale. It is designed to meet a wide range of chat use cases, such as livestreams, in-game communication, customer support, or social interactions in SaaS products. Built on [Ably's](https://ably.com/) core service, it abstracts complex details to enable efficient chat architectures.

## Supported chat features

This project is under development so we will be incrementally adding new features. At this stage, you'll find APIs for the following chat features:

- Chat rooms for 1:1, 1:many, many:1 and many:many participation.
- Sending, receiving, editing and deleting chat messages.
- Online status aka presence of chat participants.
- Chat room occupancy, i.e total number of connections and presence members.
- Typing indicators
- Room-level reactions (ephemeral at this stage)

If there are other features you'd like us to prioritize, please [let us know](https://forms.gle/mBw9M53NYuCBLFpMA).

## Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites:

- An Ably account
  - You can [sign up](https://ably.com/signup) to the generous free tier.
- An Ably API key
  - Use the default or create a new API key in an app within
    your [Ably account dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard).
